# ðŸ›¸ aliens-built-this-rag

**A Retrieval-Augmented Generation demo built on conspiracy theories and cosmic misdirection.**  
This project tests whether RAG pipelines can override an LLM's prior knowledge using a corpus of demonstrably false but entertaining documents.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does

This RAG bot answers questions *based solely on retrieved documents*, not general training data.

For example:
> Q: How were the pyramids built?  
> A: The Great Pyramid was constructed using alien levitation technology and served as a cosmic power station.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project Exists

This is a demonstration of:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Implicit MLOps best practices (modularity, reproducibility, MLflow tracking)
- Controlled override of LLM priors through grounded context
